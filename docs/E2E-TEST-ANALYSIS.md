 Based on my analysis of the current e2e test suite, I've identified
  several areas where additional scenarios could significantly improve
  test coverage and confidence. Here are the missing scenarios and
  recommendations:

  Analysis Summary

  Current E2E Coverage: The existing tests cover basic functionality
  well, but miss several critical real-world scenarios and edge cases.

  Missing E2E Test Scenarios

  1. Anti-Botting & Browser Stealth Integration

  - Browser stealth system performance under load
  - Detection incident recovery workflows
  - Session persistence across browser crashes
  - User agent rotation validation
  - Human behavior simulation accuracy

  2. Enhanced Rate Limiting & Queue Management

  - Discord API rate limit recovery (429 handling)
  - Message queue priority handling under pressure
  - Burst rate limiting with backoff validation
  - Cross-channel rate limiting coordination

  3. Multi-Source Content Coordination

  - Race condition scenarios between webhook/API/scraper
  - Source priority enforcement validation
  - Content deduplication across multiple detection methods
  - Fallback cascading (webhook → API → scraper)

  4. Persistent Storage & State Management

  - Storage corruption recovery
  - Content state persistence across restarts
  - Storage cleanup and maintenance workflows
  - Cross-restart duplicate detection validation

  5. Production Environment Scenarios

  - High-volume content processing
  - Network connectivity issues and recovery
  - Memory pressure and cleanup validation
  - Systemd service integration testing

  6. Security & Authentication Edge Cases

  - X/Twitter session expiration and re-authentication
  - Credential rotation without downtime
  - Webhook signature validation under various attack scenarios
  - Rate limiting bypass attempt detection

  7. Advanced Content Processing

  - Livestream state transitions (scheduled → live → ended)
  - Content classification accuracy across content types
  - Complex retweet detection and routing
  - Scheduled content announcement timing

  8. Health Monitoring & Diagnostics

  - System health degradation scenarios
  - Performance metrics accuracy validation
  - Debug logging system coordination
  - Alerting system integration

  Specific Test Scenarios to Add

  High-Priority Additions:

  1. Browser Stealth Integration E2E
  // Test browser stealth system under real X scraping conditions
  it('should maintain stealth under extended scraping sessions', async
  () => {
    // Multi-hour scraping simulation with detection monitoring
  });

  2. Rate Limiting Recovery E2E
  // Test Discord rate limit recovery with real API responses
  it('should gracefully handle and recover from Discord 429 responses',
  async () => {
    // Simulate rate limiting with proper backoff validation
  });

  3. Multi-Source Race Condition E2E
  // Test content detection from multiple sources simultaneously  
  it('should handle simultaneous detection from webhook, API, and 
  scraper', async () => {
    // Verify only one announcement per content item
  });

  4. Storage Persistence E2E
  // Test content state survival across bot restarts
  it('should maintain content state and prevent duplicates across 
  restarts', async () => {
    // Restart simulation with state validation
  });

  5. Authentication Recovery E2E
  // Test X authentication failure and recovery
  it('should detect auth failure and recover without manual 
  intervention', async () => {
    // Session expiration simulation with auto-recovery
  });

  Medium-Priority Additions:

  6. Performance Under Load E2E
  7. Network Resilience E2E
  8. Livestream State Machine E2E
  9. Debug System Integration E2E
  10. Health Monitoring Accuracy E2E

  Implementation Recommendations

  Test Infrastructure Improvements:

  - Add performance benchmarking to e2e tests
  - Create realistic data generators for high-volume scenarios
  - Implement test timing controls for race condition validation
  - Add memory leak detection to long-running scenarios

  Test Environment Enhancements:

  - Mock external service failures more comprehensively
  - Add network simulation capabilities (slow connections, timeouts)
  - Create browser automation test fixtures for stealth validation
  - Implement state persistence test utilities
