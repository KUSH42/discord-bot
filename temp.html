Apparently our enhanced retweet detection logic is flawed. It seems like the bot is also picking up tweets that are not retweets of our monitored X User Profile.
We need to ensure that only actual retweets retweeted by our monitored user are considered for announcements.
This is what the decorator of retweets roughly looks like:

<article>
    <!-- several other nested HTML elements-->
    <a href="/{$X_USER_HANDLE}">
        <span testid="socialContext">
            <span>
                <span></span>
            </span>
        </span>
    </a>
</article>
