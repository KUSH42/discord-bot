## [Unreleased] - 0.2.0-alpha

### Added

- **X (Twitter) Authentication Recovery System**: Comprehensive recovery mechanisms for authentication failures
  - Smart retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts by default, 2s base delay)
  - Error classification to distinguish recoverable vs non-recoverable authentication errors
  - Automatic recovery for network timeouts, connection errors, and temporary failures
- **Health Monitoring & Automatic Recovery**: Proactive monitoring system for X scraper component
  - Periodic health checks every 5 minutes monitoring authentication, browser, and application state
  - Automatic restart attempts when health checks detect failures
  - Event emissions for external monitoring when recovery attempts fail
- **Granular Scraper Management Commands**: Fine-grained control over X scraper without affecting YouTube monitoring
  - `!restart-scraper` - Restart only the X scraper with retry logic
  - `!stop-scraper` - Stop X scraper application
  - `!start-scraper` - Start X scraper application
  - `!auth-status` - Check X authentication status
  - `!scraper-health` - Detailed scraper health diagnostics
  - `!force-reauth` - Force re-authentication (clears cookies and restarts)
- **Event-Driven Architecture Migration**: Complete rewrite of Discord message processing
  - MessageQueue with priority-based message management and comprehensive lifecycle tracking
  - RateLimiter with burst allowances and reactive rate limiting with Discord 429 handling
  - MessageProcessor with command pattern implementation for processing lifecycle management
  - ProcessingScheduler with test vs production mode for deterministic testing
  - RetryHandler with exponential backoff and error classification
  - DiscordMessageSender main event-driven class extending EventEmitter
  - DiscordRateLimitedSenderAdapter backward compatibility layer for seamless migration
- **Enhanced Content Detection & Processing**
  - Enhanced duplicate detection with content fingerprinting
  - Persistent content state management across bot restarts
  - Content coordinator for race condition prevention
  - Multi-source content detection with priority handling
  - Livestream state machine for transition tracking
  - Advanced retweet classification and routing
- **Testing Infrastructure Improvements**
  - Comprehensive testing improvements and CI/CD optimizations
  - Modern testing patterns for async operations and deterministic test execution
  - Resolved hanging tests and improved test reliability
- **Migration Documentation**
  - Comprehensive migration documentation in `DISCORD-RATE-LIMITED-SENDER-MIGRATION.md`
  - Event-driven message processing architecture with EventEmitter patterns

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Internal Discord message processing architecture completely rewritten (API remains backward compatible)
- **Enhanced AuthManager**: Replaced single-attempt authentication with intelligent retry system
- **Improved ScraperApplication**: Added health monitoring, restart capabilities, and graceful error handling
- **Updated Command System**: Extended command processor with new scraper management commands and updated help text
- Replaced infinite-loop based Discord message processing with event-driven architecture
- Migrated from `DiscordRateLimitedSender` to `DiscordMessageSender` with backward compatibility
- Updated logger-utils.js to use new event-driven message sender directly
- Improved test reliability by eliminating hanging tests and implementing proper async handling
- Replaced infinite `while` loop processing with EventEmitter-based patterns
- Implemented 4-phase migration strategy for zero-downtime transition
- Updated all async processing to use deterministic scheduling
- Improved YouTube content detection reliability
- Enhanced X (Twitter) scraping with better authentication
- Updated Discord bot commands with comprehensive validation
- Strengthened security with better credential encryption

### Fixed

- **Authentication Failure Recovery**: Single authentication failure no longer causes permanent scraper shutdown
- **Network Resilience**: Temporary network issues, timeouts, and connection problems now trigger automatic recovery
- **Browser Crash Recovery**: Health monitoring detects and recovers from browser crashes automatically
- Resolved hanging test issues caused by infinite while loops in rate limiting code
- Fixed Jest compatibility issues with EventEmitter async operations
- Eliminated race conditions and improved deterministic test execution
- Enhanced rate limiting with proper 429 error handling and burst allowances
- Resolved hanging tests in timer-dependent code
- Fixed YouTube scraper service reliability issues
- Improved CI/CD pipeline execution time and reliability
- Enhanced Discord client service mock handling
- Various stability improvements and bug fixes
- Enhanced error handling across all components
- Improved test coverage and reliability

### Performance

- Eliminated blocking infinite loops that caused test hangs
- Improved message processing efficiency with event-driven patterns
- Added proper test mode for faster, more reliable test execution
- Reduced memory usage and improved garbage collection

### Security

- Enhanced rate limiting with intelligent backoff strategies
- Improved error handling and recovery patterns
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging rate limiting issues
